Happy Birthday? Message &amp; age

Using the common built-in utilities in the Java language, I created a program that would:

1) Request for your Birthday and make sure it was input correctly,
2) Calculate your age and display the date in words including which day of the week you were born on,
3) Determine which Zodiac sign you fall under,
4) Display a message of what people of that Zodiac sign tend to be like.

Enjoy!
**See if you can break the input acceptance**
